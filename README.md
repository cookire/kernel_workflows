# Kernel recommendations:


### Mi 8 Pro (equuleus)


# Kernel Labels:

The kernel label uses the following format:
- `buildDate-deviceName-buildType-kernelVariant-runNumber`
As an example you can see:
- `2025.06.18-MiA3-KSU-SM6125-22.2-148`

### buildDate
The date the kernel was built following the format: `YYYY.MM.DD`.
### deviceName
The name of the device the kernel is built for, like `MiA3`.
### buildType
The type of the build, it can be the following:
- Normal (empty)
- KSU (-KSU)
- RKSU (-RKSU)
- KSUN (-KSUN)

For SUSFS variants, the buildType receives a `.SUSFS` suffix.

### runNumber
Simply the number of the github run, don't use this as a definitive versioning metric, always base yourself on the build date.
